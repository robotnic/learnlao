# Traveler Phrasebook (topic-based)

Goal: as a traveler in Laos, these are the *most useful things to say* in each situation.

Notes:
- This is intentionally **English-first** (so it’s safe and editable). When you like a set, we can translate to Lao carefully and then add them into the app’s `phrases` + link them from each topic.
- A good “traveler phrase” is usually one of: **ask**, **confirm**, **fix a problem**, **pay**, **thank/apologize**.
